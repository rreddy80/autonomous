In this example, we first connect to the vehicle using the appropriate connection string. Then, we arm the vehicle and wait until it is armed.

Next, we set the takeoff altitude and command the vehicle to take off to the specified altitude using vehicle.simple_takeoff(). We continuously check the vehicle's altitude and wait until it reaches the target altitude.

After takeoff, we set the parameters for the spiral pattern, including the radius, maximum altitude, maximum spiral rotations, and angle per spiral. We calculate the total number of waypoints based on these parameters.

In the loop, we iterate over the number of waypoints and calculate the x, y, and z coordinates for each waypoint based on the spiral equation. We create a target location relative to the current position using LocationGlobalRelative, and command the vehicle to go to the target location using vehicle.simple_goto(). We add a small delay between each waypoint to allow the vehicle to reach the target.

Finally, we command the vehicle to land by setting the mode to "LAND" and close the vehicle connection.

Please note that flying without GPS requires careful consideration of safety and additional precautions. Ensure that you have appropriate knowledge, permissions, and safety measures in place before attempting autonomous flights without GPS.
