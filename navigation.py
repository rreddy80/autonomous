# To update the navigation system using sensor data, you need to integrate the sensor measurements into the navigation system's state estimation. The specific implementation will depend on the sensors you have available and the navigation algorithm you are using. 

# In this example, the update_navigation_system function takes in sensor data as an argument. You can extract specific measurements from the sensor data, such as IMU acceleration, GPS position, etc. Then, you can use these measurements to update different aspects of the navigation system, such as position, velocity, orientation, etc.

# The update_position, update_velocity, and update_orientation functions are provided as examples to demonstrate how you can update specific components of the navigation system using sensor measurements. You may need to adapt these functions based on your specific navigation algorithm and the sensor measurements available to you.

# Remember to implement appropriate sensor fusion techniques, filtering algorithms, or calibration procedures if necessary to ensure accurate integration of sensor data into the navigation system.
