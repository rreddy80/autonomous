# Updating the navigation system, estimating the pose, and planning the next waypoint or trajectory in an autonomous drone system involves integrating sensor data processing, pose estimation algorithms, and path planning techniques

# update_navigation_system function processes the sensor data to update the state of the navigation system, including position, velocity, and orientation. The estimate_pose function utilizes sensor data (e.g., IMU, computer vision) to estimate the drone's pose, returning the estimated pose (e.g., position, orientation).

# The plan_next_waypoint function takes the current pose and map data as inputs to plan the next waypoint or trajectory for the drone to follow. This function implements a path planning algorithm (e.g., A*, RRT, potential field) to determine the desired waypoint or trajectory.

# The autonomous_flight_loop function integrates these components within the main autonomous flight loop. It reads the sensor data, updates the navigation system, estimates the pose, plans the next waypoint, and controls the flight to reach the waypoint.
