### To read IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) data using ArduPilot, you can utilize the MAVLink protocol to communicate with the flight controller and retrieve sensor 
### information, including IMU data. 

# In this example, the code establishes a connection with the ArduPilot flight controller using the mavutil.mavlink_connection function, specifying the appropriate serial port and baud rate. It then sends a request to the flight controller to stream all data at a specific rate using the request_data_stream_send function.

# The main loop continuously waits for RAW_IMU messages and extracts the IMU data fields, such as timestamp, acceleration (in m/s^2), and gyroscope readings (in rad/s). It then prints the IMU data to the console. You can modify this code to suit your specific needs, such as saving the IMU data to a file or performing additional processing.

# Make sure to adjust the serial port (/dev/ttyUSB0) and baud rate (115200) according to your system configuration. Additionally, ensure that you have the necessary permissions and access to the serial port.

# Remember to install the pymavlink library using pip install pymavlink before running the code.

# Please note that ArduPilot offers various other ways to access and utilize sensor data, and the code provided here focuses specifically on reading IMU data using the MAVLink protocol.

from pymavlink import mavutil

# Connect to the ArduPilot flight controller
master = mavutil.mavlink_connection('/dev/ttyUSB0', baud=115200)  # Adjust the serial port and baud rate accordingly

# Request IMU data
master.mav.request_data_stream_send(
    master.target_system,  # Target system ID (typically 1 for a single drone)
    master.target_component,  # Target component ID (typically 1 for autopilot)
    mavutil.mavlink.MAV_DATA_STREAM_ALL,  # Request all data streams
    10,  # Request data every 10 milliseconds
    1  # Enable the data stream
)

# Main loop to read IMU data
while True:
    # Wait for a new message
    msg = master.recv_match(type='RAW_IMU', blocking=True)

    # Extract IMU data
    time_usec = msg.time_usec
    acc_x = msg.xacc
    acc_y = msg.yacc
    acc_z = msg.zacc
    gyro_x = msg.xgyro
    gyro_y = msg.ygyro
    gyro_z = msg.zgyro

    # Print IMU data
    print("Time (usec):", time_usec)
    print("Acceleration (m/s^2):", acc_x, acc_y, acc_z)
    print("Gyroscope (rad/s):", gyro_x, gyro_y, gyro_z)
